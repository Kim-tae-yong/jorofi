# Introduction #
JoRoFi is a Jogging Route Finder. That means, if you run / do jogging regularly and want to improve, you can make tours in a stadium, or try to find new ways, increasing running distance by at most 10% each week.
With JoRoFi, you do it the fun way: draw some routes you like to run, and JoRoFi will combine them and compute many routes until it can provides you with some you asked for: for example 7 routes between 7.5 and 8 kilometers, or 4 rooutes between 4 and 5 kilometers.
JoRoFi will surprise you with unexpected routes perhaps, but will never take you on the same route twice.


# Details #
JoRoFi read GPX as input and write GPX as output file. This can be written and read in MapSource, or read in Google Earth. But one could add new file formats !
JoRoFi do a "parcours de graphe en largeur" (need english translation, sorry), and compute fastly thousand of possible roads
